Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure.   \n",

Characters are shadows(not defined enough to even be considered parodies or mockeries of their real-life counterparts as some people like to see them), story is a shadow of a proper story( at times feeling as if written by A. I), atmosphere, with the exception of some of the battle scenes and the Russian segment, sterile and practically non existent(disasterous for Scott who is known to be one of the greatest world builders in history of the artform). Stuff just happens in the film. No significance or weight to anything or anybody... Sure, it's not all bad. The classic Ridley Scott elements are here - battles are engaging, the costumes and set designs very well-done. Something he can't help but always be good at.   \n",

I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!   \n",

It would have been much better off being a mini-series. However, apart from that, I can't really fault the movie, and it's an absolute mystery to me why everyone seems to hate it so much. Granted, I can't really judge its historical accuracy, I'm merely speaking about its merits as a drama. Well, it's beautifully shot and it never gets dull. And it's still way above average. I would definitely rank it higher than Scott's \"Last Duel\", too.   \n",

Little that i knew that this movie would not match the expectations set. First of all i would like to state that i didn't expect an historically accurate movie given the fact that it is not Ridley Scott strongest suite (see Kingdom of Heaven). There is a small measure of truth in all of his movies but they are not built as a documentary and they are not intended to be one. Nevertheless, this movie doesn't even come close to the vibe given by Kingdom of Heaven or other historical movies, from an historical point of view. I always look for a particular type of energy in movies, especially in historical ones but Napoleon in my opinion fails to deliver. This movie tries to much to contain all peculiarities of Napoleon's life but fails miserably. We see all and nothing. The feeling that i got was that we saw a fast forward version of his life but without any soul or essence. Even the battle scenes seemed dull and without soul. I think Ridley set the bar too high through his previous movies for this part. Regarding Joaquin's performance, there is not much to say. I think his interpretation was similar to a performance you would see in a stage theater. I don't know why but at some points in the movie, it felt like a low budget movie with very poor writing and very poor dialogue. I will wait for the extended version to see if my opinion changes for the best.   \n",

Why the hell was it a 2.5 hour film rather than the multi part limited series it deserves to be? The film has over 20 years of history to cover but includes so many huge time skips that you can't help feeling that you're missing out on a huge amount. This should have been a series and given the writers and the actors the time they deserved to tell the story properly but instead we get something that seems rushed and has huge gaps in time where things are shunted forward just se we can reach the end of the story before time runs out. The acting is above par (Despite Phoenix mumbling through some scenes) and the action sequences are excellent but there is just a feeling that it could have been so much more.   \n",

A spell in exile lets you gather next to water, before you gather once again to kill and slaughter, but no matter what you do, this will be your Waterloo, as all you dreams go down the pan, prisoned by water.   \n",

The fractious reaction to Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' seems to suggest that some, at least, think they do. However, in his book 'Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia,' Michael Korda posits that criticizing a film- in his case David Lean's epic 'Lawrence of Arabia'- for a lack of historical accuracy \"misses the point (as) the object was to produce, not a faithful docudrama that would educate the audience, but a hit picture.\"   \n",

A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.   \n",

More importantly, a story of such epic proportions is much better suited as a miniseries (along the lines of HBO's John Adams). In fairness, as other reviewers have mentioned, the Apple TV version was almost 4 hours long, so the theatrical version had to be cut by almost 2 hours. The result leaves the viewer trying to decipher the timeline and fill in missing details as the story leapfrogs huge gaps of time. Napoleon's character is complex and he's shown as brave, scared, sniveling, proud, steadfast and prideful. Without the full story, that odd mixture of traits is a little confusing, despite Phoenix's strengths.   \n",

The historical inaccuracies are manifold. I read that director Scott says that \"If you weren't there then you can **** off\". Well I was not there, but the erroneous simplification of one of history's greatest characters shows Scott wasn't there either. The battle scenes are gaining accolades, but even they shouldn't. Wrong and over simplified. If you are going to make a movie about Napoleon, his generalship should have taken centre-stage, not his domestic tussles with the Missus. A grand disappointment. An artilleryman, as Napoleon was, taking part in a cavalry charge? I don't think so! Oh, how I wish Kubrick had carried through to make his version. I give this six stars, mostly for having the courage to take on such a mighty story. Too bad it fell far short of its subject matter.   \n",

However, simultaneously, you have to have enough material to make a film out off. With a figure like Napoleon, the balance clearly shifts to having so much material to work with that one cinematic release may not be enough to satisfactorily portray the man's life. While this concern was already there before release, we have seen great movies about bigger-than-life men and women succeed like Gandhi (1982). And with a director like Ridley Scott, you want to give the project the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, The movie falls into the trap that has haunted other biopics which is a lack of focus. In other words, instead of elucidating a character's life, we get a collection of highlights about that character's history which doesn't build up to an overall great experience.   \n",

For those who like action you will not be disappointed the war scenes are amazing. I feel as though those giving low ratings are just salty because of the depiction of napoleon I'm not a historian but I would assume they tried to capture his personality as close to reality as they could and this may have offended the frenchies. The only thing negative I can say is that the timeline is excessively shortened in order to fit the movie time limit, it's a shame these historic movies aren't filmed over multiple movies to retain intricate detail.   \n",

Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.   \n",

It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.   \n",

In reality, especially at the beginning of his life, Napoleon was a very succesful statesman. During his time many ideas of revolution are settled. Many developments in social and economic life are realized. I could not see these things in the movie. This film can be named \"Josephine\" instead of Napoleon .   \n",

The cinematography, sets, and acting all al superb. Joaquin Phoenix, although he might have not been the best casting for a 22 year old. The Battle of Austerlitz really showcases Ridley Scott's amazing eye for shots. But even with all of that, there are some bad things. Around halfway through the film, the pacing really slows down. It is still very much enjoyable, but it could definitely be improved upon. One thing that distracted me from the plot were the scenes between Joaquin Phoenix and Vannessa Kirby's characters, where Napoleon was making animal sounds while trying to impregnate her. Overall, I enjoyed the film. A solid 8/10.   \n",

If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.   \n",

              "42  \"Napoleon\" leaves you completely indifferent and emotionally cold. In my opinion, this is the disappointment of the movie year so far. Phoenix is tragically underchallenged and grunts unmotivatedly through the \"plot\" when he's not ramming Josephine like a billy goat or sleeping standing up (I fear that this excellent actor's eyes had actually closed in the face of this direction). Sure, very beautiful images and sceneries, beautiful costumes, you can feel the huge amount of money there. But imho the whole movie is just like a series of expensive reenactments for a embarassingly sloppy researched documentary, only without a documentary in between. There is not a single truly credible interaction between the characters, the \"love story\" between Josephine and Napoleon is completely superficial (not to mention the incomprehensible idea of making the actress playing Josephine appear much younger than Napoleon, while in historical reality she was over 10 years older). Basically, this film is nothing more than a rushed sequence of the \"best of\" stations from Napoleon's life that can be found in any history book (whereby really important stations such as the discovery of the \"Rosetta Stone\" are simply swept under the table), but unfortunately it is soulless and lovelessly realised. Any hint of motivation or drama is nipped in the bud. The admittedly impressive battle scenes (which are also reeled off without any deeper emotion) can't really save the day. And then the announcement that there will be an \"in-depth lesson\", so to speak, via streaming service... I see that as a pure rip-off and a major weakness of a director as originally excellent as Ridley Scott.   \n",

I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't \"get\" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.   \n",

Gorgeously fathomed costumes, grand architecture and brutal battle scenes where if you blink you might miss a startling effect. There is also some slomo battle sequences which are welcomed as well. Well paced movie for entertainment value. Its not a deep dive into the ins and outs of European politics of the late 18th century, but a well rounded portrayal of the reign of Napoleon. Like a greatest hits album of his reign. The famous battle of Waterloo is also portrayed, having the most on screen battalions in formation I can think of. More so than the battles in the Gettysburg movie. But not as many cannon. Gettysburg has an awesome cannonade sequence that is the best put to film yet. Like 2 minutes straight of cannon firing. I love it. But, yes, the battles in Napoleon deliver striking effects and large processions of armies slaughtering each other with musket and bayonet.   \n",

To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer?

Little that i knew that this movie would not match the expectations set. First of all i would like to state that i didn't expect an historically accurate movie given the fact that it is not Ridley Scott strongest suite (see Kingdom of Heaven). There is a small measure of truth in all of his movies but they are not built as a documentary and they are not intended to be one. Nevertheless, this movie doesn't even come close to the vibe given by Kingdom of Heaven or other historical movies, from an historical point of view. I always look for a particular type of energy in movies, especially in historical ones but Napoleon in my opinion fails to deliver. This movie tries to much to contain all peculiarities of Napoleon's life but fails miserably. We see all and nothing. The feeling that i got was that we saw a fast forward version of his life but without any soul or essence. Even the battle scenes seemed dull and without soul. I think Ridley set the bar too high through his previous movies for this part. Regarding Joaquin's performance, there is not much to say. I think his interpretation was similar to a performance you would see in a stage theater. I don't know why but at some points in the movie, it felt like a low budget movie with very poor writing and very poor dialogue. I will wait for the extended version to see if my opinion changes for the best.</td>\n",

The result leaves the viewer trying to decipher the timeline and fill in missing details as the story leapfrogs huge gaps of time.

Wrong and over simplified. If you are going to make a movie about Napoleon, his generalship should have taken centre-stage, not his domestic tussles with the Missus. A grand disappointment.

The Battle of Austerlitz really showcases Ridley Scott's amazing eye for shots. But even with all of that, there are some bad things. Around halfway through the film, the pacing really slows down. It is still very much enjoyable, but it could definitely be improved upon. One thing that distracted me from the plot were the scenes between Joaquin Phoenix and Vannessa Kirby's characters, where Napoleon was making animal sounds while trying to impregnate her.

Phoenix is tragically underchallenged and grunts unmotivatedly through the \"plot\" when he's not ramming Josephine like a billy goat or sleeping standing up (I fear that this excellent actor's eyes had actually closed in the face of this direction). Sure, very beautiful images and sceneries, beautiful costumes, you can feel the huge amount of money there. But imho the whole movie is just like a series of expensive reenactments for a embarassingly sloppy researched documentary, only without a documentary in between. There is not a single truly credible interaction between the characters, the \"love story\" between Josephine and Napoleon is completely superficial (not to mention the incomprehensible idea of making the actress playing Josephine appear much younger than Napoleon, while in historical reality she was over 10 years older). Basically, this film is nothing more than a rushed sequence of the \"best of\" stations from Napoleon's life that can be found in any history book (whereby really important stations such as the discovery of the \"Rosetta Stone\" are simply swept under the table), but unfortunately it is soulless and lovelessly realised. Any hint of motivation or drama is nipped in the bud. The admittedly impressive battle scenes (which are also reeled off without any deeper emotion) can't really save the day. And then the announcement that there will be an \"in-depth lesson\", so to speak, via streaming service... I see that as a pure rip-off and a major weakness of a director as originally excellent as Ridley Scott.</td>\n",

Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content=': 3\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: Vic_max\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep\\nReview: Many of Ridley Scott\\'s movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines.

Characters are shadows(not defined enough to even be considered parodies or mockeries of their real-life counterparts as some people like to see them), story is a shadow of a proper story( at times feeling as if written by A. I), atmosphere, with the exception of some of the battle scenes and the Russian segment, sterile and practically non existent(disasterous for Scott who is known to be one of the greatest world builders in history of the artform). Stuff just happens in the film. No significance or weight to anything or anybody... Sure, it\\'s not all bad. The classic Ridley Scott elements are here - battles are engaging, the costumes and set designs very well-done. Something he can\\'t help but always be good at.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content=\": 5\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: zeki-4\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Bring on the director's cut!\\nReview: Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews.

I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=': 8\\nReview_Date: 8 March 2024\\nAuthor: UrsusProblemus\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Another reminder to not care about people\\'s opinions ever again\\nReview: Yes, the film is somewhat disjointed.

Little that i knew that this movie would not match the expectations set. First of all i would like to state that i didn't expect an historically accurate movie given the fact that it is not Ridley Scott strongest suite (see Kingdom of Heaven). There is a small measure of truth in all of his movies but they are not built as a documentary and they are not intended to be one. Nevertheless, this movie doesn't even come close to the vibe given by Kingdom of Heaven or other historical movies, from an historical point of view. I always look for a particular type of energy in movies, especially in historical ones but Napoleon in my opinion fails to deliver. This movie tries to much to contain all peculiarities of Napoleon's life but fails miserably. We see all and nothing. The feeling that i got was that we saw a fast forward version of his life but without any soul or essence. Even the battle scenes seemed dull and without soul. I think Ridley set the bar too high through his previous movies for this part. Regarding Joaquin's performance, there is not much to say. I think his interpretation was similar to a performance you would see in a stage theater. I don't know why but at some points in the movie, it felt like a low budget movie with very poor writing and very poor dialogue. I will wait for the extended version to see if my opinion changes for the best.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 14}), Document(page_content=\": 15\\nReview_Date: 25 March 2024\\nAuthor: garrywt\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Should have been a 10 part series\\nReview: There's so much available content to tell this story.

This should have been a series and given the writers and the actors the time they deserved to tell the story properly but instead we get something that seems rushed and has huge gaps in time where things are shunted forward just se we can reach the end of the story before time runs out.

This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 24}), Document(page_content=\": 25\\nReview_Date: 22 January 2024\\nAuthor: egruber130\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Would Have Been Better as a Miniseries\\nReview: As usual, Phoenix is very good, but there just seems to be something missing from his character. More importantly, a story of such epic proportions is much better suited as a miniseries (along the lines of HBO's John Adams). In fairness, as other reviewers have mentioned, the Apple TV version was almost 4 hours long, so the theatrical version had to be cut by almost 2 hours. The result leaves the viewer trying to decipher the timeline and fill in missing details as the story leapfrogs huge gaps of time. Napoleon's character is complex and he's shown as brave, scared, sniveling, proud, steadfast and prideful. Without the full story, that odd mixture of traits is a little confusing, despite Phoenix's strengths.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 25}), Document(page_content=\": 26\\nReview_Date: 19 December 2023\\nAuthor: skybiscuits\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Yeah, nah\\nReview: Dog's breakfast of a movie.

Well I was not there, but the erroneous simplification of one of history\\'s greatest characters shows Scott wasn\\'t there either. The battle scenes are gaining accolades, but even they shouldn\\'t.

However, simultaneously, you have to have enough material to make a film out off. With a figure like Napoleon, the balance clearly shifts to having so much material to work with that one cinematic release may not be enough to satisfactorily portray the man's life. While this concern was already there before release, we have seen great movies about bigger-than-life men and women succeed like Gandhi (1982). And with a director like Ridley Scott, you want to give the project the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, The movie falls into the trap that has haunted other biopics which is a lack of focus. In other words, instead of elucidating a character's life, we get a collection of highlights about that character's history which doesn't build up to an overall great experience.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 28}), Document(page_content=\": 29\\nReview_Date: 24 November 2023\\nAuthor: esyurt\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Great balance of action and drama.\\nReview: The movie consists of a beautiful balance of drama and action.

It is still very much enjoyable, but it could definitely be improved upon.

If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 40}), Document(page_content=': 41\\nReview_Date: 9 January 2024\\nAuthor: brucesarn-36583\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: A King By Another Name\\nReview: A Hollywood film tells a story, it entertains.

In my opinion, this is the disappointment of the movie year so far. Phoenix is tragically underchallenged and grunts unmotivatedly through the \"plot\" when he\\'s not ramming Josephine like a billy goat or sleeping standing up (I fear that this excellent actor\\'s eyes had actually closed in the face of this direction). Sure, very beautiful images and sceneries, beautiful costumes, you can feel the huge amount of money there. But imho the whole movie is just like a series of expensive reenactments for a embarassingly sloppy researched documentary, only without a documentary in between. There is not a single truly credible interaction between the characters, the \"love story\" between Josephine and Napoleon is completely superficial (not to mention the incomprehensible idea of making the actress playing Josephine appear much younger than Napoleon, while in historical reality she was over 10 years older). Basically, this film is nothing more than a rushed sequence of the \"best of\" stations from Napoleon\\'s life that can be found in any history book (whereby really important stations such as the discovery of the \"Rosetta Stone\" are simply swept under the table), but unfortunately it is soulless and lovelessly realised. Any hint of motivation or drama is nipped in the bud. The admittedly impressive battle scenes (which are also reeled off without any deeper emotion) can\\'t really save the day. And then the announcement that there will be an \"in-depth lesson\", so to speak, via streaming service... I see that as a pure rip-off and a major weakness of a director as originally excellent as Ridley Scott.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 42}), Document(page_content=': 43\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: javier_arriagada94\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Disappointing/Misleading\\nReview: When you see the trailer for this movie you get really high expectations, but then you watch it...\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 43}), Document(page_content=': 44\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: itsahoverboard\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: \"I don\\'t know what to do.\" - Joaquin Phoenix, ten days before start Napoleon production\\nReview: Yes, that\\'s a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming.

Gorgeously fathomed costumes, grand architecture and brutal battle scenes where if you blink you might miss a startling effect. There is also some slomo battle sequences which are welcomed as well. Well paced movie for entertainment value. Its not a deep dive into the ins and outs of European politics of the late 18th century, but a well rounded portrayal of the reign of Napoleon. Like a greatest hits album of his reign. The famous battle of Waterloo is also portrayed, having the most on screen battalions in formation I can think of. More so than the battles in the Gettysburg movie. But not as many cannon. Gettysburg has an awesome cannonade sequence that is the best put to film yet. Like 2 minutes straight of cannon firing. I love it. But, yes, the battles in Napoleon deliver striking effects and large processions of armies slaughtering each other with musket and bayonet.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 49})]\n"

Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic.

This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 24}), Document(page_content=\": 25\\nReview_Date: 22 January 2024\\nAuthor: egruber130\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Would Have Been Better as a Miniseries\\nReview: As usual, Phoenix is very good, but there just seems to be something missing from his character. More importantly, a story of such epic proportions is much better suited as a miniseries (along the lines of HBO's John Adams). In fairness, as other reviewers have mentioned, the Apple TV version was almost 4 hours long, so the theatrical version had to be cut by almost 2 hours. The result leaves the viewer trying to decipher the timeline and fill in missing details as the story leapfrogs huge gaps of time. Napoleon's character is complex and he's shown as brave, scared, sniveling, proud, steadfast and prideful. Without the full story, that odd mixture of traits is a little confusing, despite Phoenix's strengths.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 25}), Document(page_content=\": 26\\nReview_Date: 19 December 2023\\nAuthor: skybiscuits\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Yeah, nah\\nReview: Dog's breakfast of a movie.

However, simultaneously, you have to have enough material to make a film out off. With a figure like Napoleon, the balance clearly shifts to having so much material to work with that one cinematic release may not be enough to satisfactorily portray the man's life. While this concern was already there before release, we have seen great movies about bigger-than-life men and women succeed like Gandhi (1982). And with a director like Ridley Scott, you want to give the project the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, The movie falls into the trap that has haunted other biopics which is a lack of focus. In other words, instead of elucidating a character's life, we get a collection of highlights about that character's history which doesn't build up to an overall great experience.\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 28}), Document(page_content='Review_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 28}), Document(page_content=\": 29\\nReview_Date: 24 November 2023\\nAuthor: esyurt\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Great balance of action and drama.\\nReview: The movie consists of a beautiful balance of drama and action.

It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose.

The Battle of Austerlitz really showcases Ridley Scott's amazing eye for shots. But even with all of that, there are some bad things. Around halfway through the film, the pacing really slows down. It is still very much enjoyable, but it could definitely be improved upon. One thing that distracted me from the plot were the scenes between Joaquin Phoenix and Vannessa Kirby's characters, where Napoleon was making animal sounds while trying to impregnate her.

            "Review: Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.\n",

I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't \"get\" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.\n",

Little that i knew that this movie would not match the expectations set. First of all i would like to state that i didn't expect an historically accurate movie given the fact that it is not Ridley Scott strongest suite (see Kingdom of Heaven). There is a small measure of truth in all of his movies but they are not built as a documentary and they are not intended to be one. Nevertheless, this movie doesn't even come close to the vibe given by Kingdom of Heaven or other historical movies, from an historical point of view. I always look for a particular type of energy in movies, especially in historical ones but Napoleon in my opinion fails to deliver. This movie tries to much to contain all peculiarities of Napoleon's life but fails miserably. We see all and nothing.

I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details.

Why the hell was it a 2.5 hour film rather than the multi part limited series it deserves to be? The film has over 20 years of history to cover but includes so many huge time skips that you can't help feeling that you're missing out on a huge amount. This should have been a series and given the writers and the actors the time they deserved to tell the story properly but instead we get something that seems rushed and has huge gaps in time where things are shunted forward just se we can reach the end of the story before time runs out. The acting is above par (Despite Phoenix mumbling through some scenes) and the action sequences are excellent but there is just a feeling that it could have been so much more.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9450588/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 15}),\n",
