Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure.   \n",

              "4    Ridley Scott's Napoleon is a high-budget cinematic exercise in \"Whatever, man, that'll do.\"\\nThe film, both in terms of what it presents and how it presents, reeks of hollowness. Characters are shadows(not defined enough to even be considered parodies or mockeries of their real-life counterparts as some people like to see them), story is a shadow of a proper story( at times feeling as if written by A. I), atmosphere, with the exception of some of the battle scenes and the Russian segment, sterile and practically non existent(disasterous for Scott who is known to be one of the greatest world builders in history of the artform). Stuff just happens in the film. No significance or weight to anything or anybody... Sure, it's not all bad. The classic Ridley Scott elements are here - battles are engaging, the costumes and set designs very well-done. Something he can't help but always be good at.   \n",

The costumes, hairstyling, makeup, sets and set design were well done for the historical period. The battle scenes were well executed but brief. Casting was good but the acting was devoid of depth and genuine emotion. Joaquin Phoenix interpretation of Napoleon was a caricature and I was disappointed with his lack of development in his role of Napoleon. The same can be said for the role of Josephine. The musical score was deficient throughout most of the movie. I really was looking forward to seeing this movie as I expected Phoenix to be riveting in the role of Napoleon, but he and the movie was disappointing.   \n",

Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content=': 3\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: Vic_max\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep\\nReview: Many of Ridley Scott\\'s movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines.

Characters are shadows(not defined enough to even be considered parodies or mockeries of their real-life counterparts as some people like to see them), story is a shadow of a proper story( at times feeling as if written by A. I), atmosphere, with the exception of some of the battle scenes and the Russian segment, sterile and practically non existent(disasterous for Scott who is known to be one of the greatest world builders in history of the artform). Stuff just happens in the film. No significance or weight to anything or anybody... Sure, it\\'s not all bad.

I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=': 8\\nReview_Date: 8 March 2024\\nAuthor: UrsusProblemus\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Another reminder to not care about people\\'s opinions ever again\\nReview: Yes, the film is somewhat disjointed.

Little that i knew that this movie would not match the expectations set. First of all i would like to state that i didn't expect an historically accurate movie given the fact that it is not Ridley Scott strongest suite (see Kingdom of Heaven). There is a small measure of truth in all of his movies but they are not built as a documentary and they are not intended to be one. Nevertheless, this movie doesn't even come close to the vibe given by Kingdom of Heaven or other historical movies, from an historical point of view. I always look for a particular type of energy in movies, especially in historical ones but Napoleon in my opinion fails to deliver. This movie tries to much to contain all peculiarities of Napoleon's life but fails miserably. We see all and nothing. The feeling that i got was that we saw a fast forward version of his life but without any soul or essence. Even the battle scenes seemed dull and without soul. I think Ridley set the bar too high through his previous movies for this part. Regarding Joaquin's performance, there is not much to say. I think his interpretation was similar to a performance you would see in a stage theater. I don't know why but at some points in the movie, it felt like a low budget movie with very poor writing and very poor dialogue. I will wait for the extended version to see if my opinion changes for the best.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 14}), Document(page_content=': 15\\nReview_Date: 1 December 2023\\nAuthor: jmperfetti\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Looks Epic, does NOT FEEL EPIC\\nReview: Most people will agree that this film is visually stunning.

The film has over 20 years of history to cover but includes so many huge time skips that you can't help feeling that you're missing out on a huge amount. This should have been a series and given the writers and the actors the time they deserved to tell the story properly but instead we get something that seems rushed and has huge gaps in time where things are shunted forward just se we can reach the end of the story before time runs out. The acting is above par (Despite Phoenix mumbling through some scenes) and the action sequences are excellent but there is just a feeling that it could have been so much more.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 16}), Document(page_content=': 17\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: Vince_D\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: It was OK but messy - Maybe the 4-hour cut is better?\\nReview: I went in wanting and expecting to like it but came out thinking it was a disjointed mess.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 17}), Document(page_content=\": 18\\nReview_Date: 30 November 2023\\nAuthor: Masami-J\\nRating: \\nReview_Title: A film I don't recommend\\nReview: Napoleon by Ridley Scott is a film about Napoleon Bonaparte, but it is a very fictional film, many sequences of the film do not correspond to historical reality.

This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 24}), Document(page_content=\": 25\\nReview_Date: 22 January 2024\\nAuthor: egruber130\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Would Have Been Better as a Miniseries\\nReview: As usual, Phoenix is very good, but there just seems to be something missing from his character. More importantly, a story of such epic proportions is much better suited as a miniseries (along the lines of HBO's John Adams). In fairness, as other reviewers have mentioned, the Apple TV version was almost 4 hours long, so the theatrical version had to be cut by almost 2 hours. The result leaves the viewer trying to decipher the timeline and fill in missing details as the story leapfrogs huge gaps of time. Napoleon's character is complex and he's shown as brave, scared, sniveling, proud, steadfast and prideful. Without the full story, that odd mixture of traits is a little confusing, despite Phoenix's strengths.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 25}), Document(page_content=': 26\\nReview_Date: 10 December 2023\\nAuthor: trevjohns\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Should have been called Napoleon and Josephine\\nReview: This should have been called \"Napoleon and Josephine\" because, frankly, there\\'s too much of Josephine in it, and not nearly enough of the brilliance and personality of Bonaparte. The historical inaccuracies are manifold. I read that director Scott says that \"If you weren\\'t there then you can **** off\". Well I was not there, but the erroneous simplification of one of history\\'s greatest characters shows Scott wasn\\'t there either. The battle scenes are gaining accolades, but even they shouldn\\'t. Wrong and over simplified. If you are going to make a movie about Napoleon, his generalship should have taken centre-stage, not his domestic tussles with the Missus. A grand disappointment. An artilleryman, as Napoleon was, taking part in a cavalry charge? I don\\'t think so! Oh, how I wish Kubrick had carried through to make his version. I give this six stars, mostly for having the courage to take on such a mighty story. Too bad it fell far short of its subject matter.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 26}), Document(page_content=\": 27\\nReview_Date: 4 December 2023\\nAuthor: Ezpl8yer\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Just like Napoleon himself, Ridley Scott overreaches\\nReview: With every biopic, the question is always: how do you condense a person's life in a 2 or 3 hour motion picture? However, simultaneously, you have to have enough material to make a film out off. With a figure like Napoleon, the balance clearly shifts to having so much material to work with that one cinematic release may not be enough to satisfactorily portray the man's life. While this concern was already there before release, we have seen great movies about bigger-than-life men and women succeed like Gandhi (1982). And with a director like Ridley Scott, you want to give the project the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, The movie falls into the trap that has haunted other biopics which is a lack of focus. In other words, instead of elucidating a character's life, we get a collection of highlights about that character's history which doesn't build up to an overall great experience.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 27}), Document(page_content=\": 28\\nReview_Date: 19 December 2023\\nAuthor: skybiscuits\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Yeah, nah\\nReview: Dog's breakfast of a movie.

Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 31}), Document(page_content=': 32\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: groeneveld-39547\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: good movie. ignore the bad reviews!\\nReview: In my oppion its a very good movie that they involveld the love letters between Napoleon and Josephine.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 32}), Document(page_content=': 33\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: WadoodS\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Napoleon Deserved Better\\nReview: Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 33}), Document(page_content=': 34\\nReview_Date: 3 April 2024\\nAuthor: frogcilfruit\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Why bother with actual history...\\nReview: ...when you can use a famous historical figure for publicity and just make up an alternate story that better fits your views, whims, or \"vision\" ?\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 34}), Document(page_content=\": 35\\nReview_Date: 9 December 2023\\nAuthor: adambarta\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Hollywood overtaking over quality\\nReview: Once I found out that there will be a movie about Napoleon starring Joaquin Phoenix, I got excited.

The cinematography, sets, and acting all al superb. Joaquin Phoenix, although he might have not been the best casting for a 22 year old. The Battle of Austerlitz really showcases Ridley Scott's amazing eye for shots. But even with all of that, there are some bad things. Around halfway through the film, the pacing really slows down. It is still very much enjoyable, but it could definitely be improved upon. One thing that distracted me from the plot were the scenes between Joaquin Phoenix and Vannessa Kirby's characters, where Napoleon was making animal sounds while trying to impregnate her. Overall, I enjoyed the film. A solid 8/10.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 38}), Document(page_content=': 39\\nReview_Date: 10 January 2024\\nAuthor: diponsakib\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: A Triumphant Look at Ridley Scott\\'s \"Napoleon\"\\nReview: Ridley Scott has once again tackled a titan of history, and with \"Napoleon,\" he delivers a film as epic and intoxicating as its subject.

If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 40}), Document(page_content=': 41\\nReview_Date: 9 January 2024\\nAuthor: brucesarn-36583\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: A King By Another Name\\nReview: A Hollywood film tells a story, it entertains.

In my opinion, this is the disappointment of the movie year so far. Phoenix is tragically underchallenged and grunts unmotivatedly through the \"plot\" when he\\'s not ramming Josephine like a billy goat or sleeping standing up (I fear that this excellent actor\\'s eyes had actually closed in the face of this direction). Sure, very beautiful images and sceneries, beautiful costumes, you can feel the huge amount of money there. But imho the whole movie is just like a series of expensive reenactments for a embarassingly sloppy researched documentary, only without a documentary in between. There is not a single truly credible interaction between the characters, the \"love story\" between Josephine and Napoleon is completely superficial (not to mention the incomprehensible idea of making the actress playing Josephine appear much younger than Napoleon, while in historical reality she was over 10 years older). Basically, this film is nothing more than a rushed sequence of the \"best of\" stations from Napoleon\\'s life that can be found in any history book (whereby really important stations such as the discovery of the \"Rosetta Stone\" are simply swept under the table), but unfortunately it is soulless and lovelessly realised. Any hint of motivation or drama is nipped in the bud. The admittedly impressive battle scenes (which are also reeled off without any deeper emotion) can\\'t really save the day. And then the announcement that there will be an \"in-depth lesson\", so to speak, via streaming service... I see that as a pure rip-off and a major weakness of a director as originally excellent as Ridley Scott.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 42}), Document(page_content=': 43\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: javier_arriagada94\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Disappointing/Misleading\\nReview: When you see the trailer for this movie you get really high expectations, but then you watch it...\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 43}), Document(page_content=': 44\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: itsahoverboard\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: \"I don\\'t know what to do.\" - Joaquin Phoenix, ten days before start Napoleon production\\nReview: Yes, that\\'s a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming.

Gorgeously fathomed costumes, grand architecture and brutal battle scenes where if you blink you might miss a startling effect. There is also some slomo battle sequences which are welcomed as well. Well paced movie for entertainment value. Its not a deep dive into the ins and outs of European politics of the late 18th century, but a well rounded portrayal of the reign of Napoleon. Like a greatest hits album of his reign. The famous battle of Waterloo is also portrayed, having the most on screen battalions in formation I can think of. More so than the battles in the Gettysburg movie. But not as many cannon. Gettysburg has an awesome cannonade sequence that is the best put to film yet. Like 2 minutes straight of cannon firing. I love it. But, yes, the battles in Napoleon deliver striking effects and large processions of armies slaughtering each other with musket and bayonet.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 49}), Document(page_content=\": 50\\nReview_Date: 28 April 2024\\nAuthor: boutzarelis\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: More is less.

Allways too obsessed with Josephine and with little to no coherence at all between scenes. It takes you from Paris to Egypt and back in less than five minutes and three scenes. It doesn't explain any of his action and we almost never see the immediate consequences of them, it just changes scene upon scene with nothing connecting them other than years passed. Phoenix acts good but and the visuals are excellent but it comes out too shallow and rushed and empty. I guess a director's cut with about 2 hours more material (that will double the length of the movie) is the only thing that will fix it.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 50}), Document(page_content=': 51\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: nlcckc\\nRating: 2\\nReview_Title: Well that was painful\\nReview: So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes?

There are also many relevant historical facts missing from the film, including some large and other minute details that could have easily been sprinkled in. This in spite of the movie being roughly 2 hours & 40 minutes long. As a counterpoint, Director Ridley Scott never claimed to make the movie completely historically factual; and the film is debatably more historically anchored than a lot of other films which claim to be \"based on true events\".\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 53}), Document(page_content=\": 54\\nReview_Date: 25 November 2023\\nAuthor: malmevik77\\nRating: 2\\nReview_Title: What's the French word for crap?\\nReview: Napoleon\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 54}), Document(page_content=': 55\\nReview_Date: 11 December 2023\\nAuthor: ciaransweeney-25817\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: The reviews here are very harsh\\nReview: I have just arrived home from the cinema from seeing this film.

In addition, it didn't seem historically accurate as it also didn't concentrate on his mistakes such as the Continental System and the outrage of the French people after crowning himself King. The French Revolution was about overthrowing a monarch, yet he crowns himself king. The entire movie focused on his beloved wife, Josephine.

I really thought I was going to watch a movie about Napoleon. But two hours into it I realized I'm actually watching a movie about the English. Scott made short shrift of Napoleon's victories and spent 40 minutes on Waterloo. One of the greatest tactical minds in history and the man who terrorized the whole of Europe is reduced here to a grotesque caricature. Phoenix, otherwise an excellent actor, lacks charisma as Napoleon and the two protagonists (Napoleon and Josephine) have zero chemistry. Given the hype created around it, I consider the movie a flop. Scott has fallen knee deep into the trap of artistic hubris, as he arrogantly believes he's entitled to remake and reshape historical figures with impunity. If he wants full freedom, there's always fiction, an endless reservoir of stories, but when you're bringing to the screen one of the most (in)famous characters in history, more reverence is needed. Scott's iconoclastic bravado is now being punished by the public. It makes me very nervous to think that he's working on a new Gladiator. That's truly bad news.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 67}), Document(page_content=\": 68\\nReview_Date: 29 November 2023\\nAuthor: UniqueParticle\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Very enjoyable\\nReview: This is an extraordinary film.

The practical effects in this are soooo good this helps cleanse the pallet after decades of green screen super hero's! We have a refreshing new look in to Napoleon! Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar again or at least get a nod from the guild then the Oscar's are truly dead, well when you pick Jimmy Kimmel to be the front man then you know they are dead.

Sadly, the dramatic content in some of his movies leaves something to be desired. Chiefly, Scott displays his considerable flair for choreography in staging the sprawling battle scenes in \"Napoleon.\" Joaquin Phoenix, Vanessa Kirby, and Rupert Everett headline a cast of thousands. Unfortunately, the blood, guts, and thunder of combat overshadow the quieter moments of the Corsican-born tactician\\'s life. Whereas the battlefield scenes bristle with excitement, suspense, and bravado, Napoleon\\'s life off the field of valor proves far less volatile. Scott creates several 19th century combat scenes that rival Steven Spielberg\\'s 20th century World War II epic \"Saving Private Ryan.\" For example, the horse the eponymous hero rides in his first foray against the British at Toulon has its chest torn open by a cannonball! The chief problem with \"Napoleon\" is Scott himself. He treats Napoleon with nothing but contempt. Since Scott is British, this should come as no surprise.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 77}), Document(page_content=': 78\\nReview_Date: 15 December 2023\\nAuthor: DLochner\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Weird, but good\\nReview: An unusual and strange film adaptation of the life of Napoleon Bonaparte. This is also unusual for director Ridley Scott, who usually stands for strong action cinema, and here he completely gets involved in dramatic dialogues and a kind of love story. He also implements this phenomenally and well. I expected more battles and more military, but what I got was a romantic film. Is this good or bad? Bad because at over two and a half hours it drags a bit. Good, because the love story is very well told and the short but crisp battle scenes are simply very convincing. The film is worth seeing, but should be viewed with different expectations from the start. A very good film in its own way. Croatia Phoenix in particular is playing phenomenally. Weird, but good.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 78}), Document(page_content=': 79\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: kianjames-02823\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: France...Army...Josephine.\\nReview: Hmmmmm.

It also covers his relationship with Josephine, with times of love, separation, and infidelity. At over 2-1/2 hours, it seems long, but in viewing, it seems to be an attempt at an Epic, but very rushed, as various characters seem to cameo and disappear. One example is Josephine's daughter, who seemed to appear out of nowhere, whrn Josephine was supposed to be infertile.

HE CONQUERED EVERYTHING.\\nReview: Ridley Scott's most recent epic Napoleon was a beautiful film when it came to visuals, set pieces and overall cinematography. Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby share the screen perfectly and show a lot of talent(which comes to no surprise) and amazing chemistry. From a story standpoint, I can understand that it is tough to illustrate all aspects of Napoleon's life into a reasonable length film, and I am pleased with the outcome and highlights they decided to showcase (his rise to emperor and fall to excile while dealing with his love, Josephine). However I will state that if they were to release an extended version, I will not hesitate to watch that. The visuals from this film were outstanding, especially when it came to the battle sequences. The feeling of being close to the battles and witnessing the gore and violence that followed was breathtaking. The score and the cinematography were used brilliantly and at some points I had chills. Now the obvious issue spotted in the film that Im sure most people are talking about, goes to the lack of accents to help with the authenticity. The fact that we were in France and not a single person spoke with a French accent was kind of a letdown.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 91}), Document(page_content=\": 92\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: BenW1999\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Another underachievement from Scott.\\nReview: I'm sure we all expected an Epic Biographical War Drama ... and I'm even more sure we didn't expect to get a a Period RomCom.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 92}), Document(page_content=\": 93\\nReview_Date: 26 November 2023\\nAuthor: jozenerd\\nRating: 3\\nReview_Title: It's a shame Scott just lost this huge opportunity\\nReview: During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles.

About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!!

Ridley Scott long ago etched his name on the list of filmmakers whose projects are nearly always interesting and deserving of a watch. After all, he has helmed such beloved classics as ALIEN (1979), BLADE RUNNER (1982), THELMA AND LOUISE (1991), and Best Picture winner GLADIATOR (2009). Returning to the historical epic genre and working from a script by his ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD writer, David Scarpa, Scott takes on the life and legend of Napoleon Bonaparte. Of course, that legend is a bit conflicted since Napoleon and his bicorne hat remains a hero to France, yet something less to England.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 95}), Document(page_content=': 96\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: theRetiree\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: What were they thinking?\\nReview: Just came from a full theater.

Phoenix also produced the film alongside the film's director (along with a few more). Ridley Scott created another film which needs a director's cut like Kingdom of Heaven. Napoleon is a great film if you go into not thinking it'll be the ultimate movie about the emperor and historical figure, instead strap in for a film with authentic costumes and battle sequences along with actors and crew who bring it to the screen. This is a film which heavily dramatizes his life and not a documentary. Critics disliked the film for its historical inaccuracies and the French critics' reviews were mostly negative, understandable if you're thinking about the inaccuracies. David Scarpa (the screenwriter) and Ridley Scott could easily have done a better job with making it more historically accurate. Here's hoping Steven Spielberg's mini series about the French Emperor will be more accurate, I think it will. The Waterloo was flawless though, accurate in lots of ways. Ridley Scott gave us an entertaining film which is a must watch if you're fan of the director's other work, also an insight of Napoleon's life which can't be told in 157 minutes of run time.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 98}), Document(page_content=\": 99\\nReview_Date: 19 December 2023\\nAuthor: ma-cortes\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Lavish and historic fiction piece about Napoleon and his wife Josephine\\nReview: The film is partially based on historic deeds but predominates the sentimental drama and detailing the checkered rise and fall of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and his relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his wife, Josephine, developing their parallels lives.

Paul Barras, in reality a genuine rival and enemy of Napoleon and one of Napoleon's fiercest opponents within France during his rise to power (while being romantically involved with Josephine prior to her involvement with Napoleon), is almost never shown as such, while the lengthy maneuvering to get his plan for the recapture of Toulon approved, which required alliance with powerful officials separate from Barras, is never shown. Napoleon's early campaign in Italy, where he faced three powerful Austrian armies, defeated them all after ferocious fighting, and in so doing really did save Revolutionary France from destruction, is never depicted. The Battle of Marengo, when Napoleon genuinely lost a battle and only had it regained due to the timely intervention of his lieutenant Louis Desaix, killed in the battle, is never depicted. His ordering of the arrest and execution of the Duc d'Enghien, the French royal heir - one of the most-momentous decisions in Napoleon's entire career - is never depicted. These are only the most-egregious errors in this muddled morass. The battles that are depicted are portrayed without any perception of the strategic maneuvering and adaptation that preceded and defined the battles themselves. In rushing to cover the entirety of Napoleon's career in a mere feature length, the film descends into a muddled non-entity of noise, blood, and confusion. Joaquin Phoenix's atrocious performance is completely at variance with the real man Napoleon was. Rupert Everett as the Duke of Wellington delivers the only competent performance in the entire film - and that in a supporting role.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 103}), Document(page_content=\": 104\\nReview_Date: 1 December 2023\\nAuthor: mm-39\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Joaquin Phoenix best role so far!\\nReview: Napoleon, so far, is Joaquin Phoenix best role! There is a small does of Wokism thrown at this film, but Scott like Napoleon fought it off, and made a believable historical movie. Unlike Hollywood's comic book greatest films ever movies Napoleon goes with Scott's giving a real feeling for the times. There is a casting, look, sets all done for such a gritty and dirty feel of old Europe. Elite which rule, and the revolution. Miserable times create revolution is a good theme. Beheadings, affairs, the commission of terror all made good sub story for the rise of Napoleon. Napoleon character is excellent portrayed by Phoenix smart, arrogant, lustful, and emotional weakness all rolled into one. Napoleon is directed at a fast pace, which blends the romance Josephine ( love hate usury) with political and war scenes. The traumatic marriages, meetings with the Tsar, Kings went smoothly and entreatingly as Phoenix mixes with the other character. Of course there is time constraints, and entertainment liberties. The Wellington/Napoleon exchanges are golden. Wellington's arrogances and distain for the un royal Napoleon resonates.

Otherwise it's battles, working his way up to Consul, and occasional meetings with other important rulers and statesmen, few of whom impress, save for Rupert Everett's canny and psychologically perceptive Wellington.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 105}), Document(page_content=\": 106\\nReview_Date: 27 November 2023\\nAuthor: molinapolo\\nRating: 1\\nReview_Title: Ridley's worst film\\nReview: This is unfortunately Ridley's worst film. From the start the plot feels improvised, as if like he left the actors play and do they're own thing. He had a marquee set of actors, but non of them stand out including Joaquin Phoenix which compared with his performance in Gladiator (first Ridley's film with him) it is a long fall, anyone could have done that part. The screenplay is also clumsy, feels like some sort of documentary without a narrator. And the worst part is that Ridley's interpretation of Napoleon, he puts the main character as a ridiculous man who didn't have any merit and his accomplishments were reached by chance. The war scenes are the only parts of this movie we can rescue, where Ridley is a master. To conclude, perhaps I had too much expectations for this movie being a Ridley's fan I regret to say that didn't hit the target this time.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 106}), Document(page_content=\": 107\\nReview_Date: 4 December 2023\\nAuthor: wathfrancesca\\nRating: \\nReview_Title: Discontinuous, inaccurate, imperfect and sometimes much boring.

Ridley Scott is a brilliant director, but, like his subject, his reach exceeded his grasp. The actors are quite good; the contests at Toulon, Borodino, and Austerlitz are covered, but, Russia, where he lost his empire is given scant review. The final defeat at Waterloo is well-staged. The film's major virtue is its fealty to the period: the sets, costumes, makeup, props, and lighting are impeccably reproduced. It is very worthy to be immersed in an earlier period, if only to see how it contrasts with our own, but, alone, it does not make for great drama.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 112}), Document(page_content=\": 113\\nReview_Date: 27 November 2023\\nAuthor: hanschsolo\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Vastly entertaining but shallow, lacking depth\\nReview: Napoleon is so greatly shot and acted, Joaquin Phoenix fits the role and plays the character in various sets of emotions. He brings more to Napoleon than the standard assumption that he's just an Strategical master in the battle field.. but.. here we got the problem. He's much more than that, He's an emotionally devastated character. But not in the way Ridley Scott sees him to be. Because of his emotional unavailability, he cares only for himself. Napoleons Ego is huge, and most of the Letters and reports from people within that time confirm it. Josephine is just like a ladder in his life, he needs it to succeed and have motivation to return home in the battlefield. You could say she's just an object for him\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 113}), Document(page_content=': 114\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: M_Exchange\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: I would have loved the Kubrick version.\\nReview: As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life.

So what\\'s wrong with this film? Well, quite a lot of things when I really think about it. What have you done, Ridley? At first I thought surely Ridley Scott of all people will massively step up on a theme such as Napoleon. Spoiler alert - he didn\\'t. Josephine? Come on man, of all things we could have seen? This is freaking Napoleon, one of the greatest generals ever, a megalomaniac, the Ceasar of France!!! Some of the greatest battles happened under his rule. The fighting scenes were truly disappointing. What were you thinking, Ridley? \"Surely nobody will care about some of the most glorious battles of all time such as Austerlitz and Vaterloo, or the road to Moscow, EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE FREAKING JOSEPHINE, BROTHER!\" Another problem was Joaquin Phoenix, he was lost, that was not his role, it should have never been him, it just didn\\'t work, no disrespect to his genius of course. The worst thing of all though, the pacing of this damn thing. Almost 3 hours. That\\'s alright, the theme of the movie allows it. But you dragged some of the most boring stuff to go through the most important things about Napoleon in mere minutes. I don\\'t get it, I never will. I don\\'t hate the movie by any means... it\\'s just not what it should have been! It should have been a tour de force! It should have been glorious and mesmerising! It should have been like Gladiator! It should have been a masterpiece! It wasn\\'t!

He was absolutely right. Despite the middling reviews, I\\'d say this film was a solid effort. If anything, it did feel a bit too self-aware and because of that it often poked fun at itself (and its main character). The accents were a bit distracting, but I\\'m not sure what could have been done there. Phoenix\\'s Bonaparte often overplays his American accent and it seems in stark contrast to Kirby\\'s English. By the way, Vanessa Kirby was the best thing about this movie. Shame we couldn\\'t have seen more of her. The action sequences were also very well done and I\\'m glad Scott didn\\'t try to make them more artsy. In many ways this film is a reach back to Gladiator and other period dramas of yesterday that we need more of in the future.

Filmmaking is not an easy job at all and he does it with such a good eye! I am very happy that I saw this in theaters, as I never got to see many of his other movies in theaters. The epic battle scenes he directs are made for the big screen, as well as the dramatic and captivating performances of the legendary Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby. Very fascinating characters and everything that revolves around Napoleon's personality and ego with both his political leadership and his marriage I found to be quite the character exploration and worthy of analysis. The movie held my attention pretty much the entire time! While some things may not be ENTIRELY history accurate and while it does jump around a lot between years, the filmmaking and writing are still done well. I liked the score too, very riveting!

He was so involved into this gIgantic project that the legend says he read and searched for everything that Napoleon did each day of his life. EACH DAY OF HIS LIFE. But after the disaster of 1970 WATERLOO, the project falled into the hole. Now, Ridely Scott at last made it with many Kubrick\\'s notes. I knew this film was cut: 90 minutes, and at first I did not want to see on a big screen because of that. But I wanted to see those awesome battles on a large screen. That\\'s all. And I don\\'t belong to this kind of \"bulk\" audiences, superficial audiences, who go and watch NAPOLEON only for the battle scenes, and who don\\'t care at all about Josephine\\'s stuff about her private affairs - the supposed deleted scenes - which would have lenghthened the movie for ninety minutes more. I agree that 4h 30 minutes is a VERY LONG TIME in a movie theater, with seats not always comfortable, idiots who eat, read their cell phone messages, whisper to their relatives sitting besides them, and above all BESIDES YOU...So at home, on a DVD or on a streaming platform, you are much quieter to watch 4h 30 of a film or series. You can make breaks as long as you wish.... So I belong to this second kind of audiences, who are very demanding, wishing details, deep analysis of specific matters. I don\\'t belong to the bulk, that\\'s why I will watch it on Apple later. ONLY the big screen \"feeling\" concerning the battles pushed me to the movie theater. I will finish by saying that Ridley Scott was lucky to make what he wished, despite producers pressure. I don\\'t blame those Wall Street bankers and stock market financiers who know nothing in movie art, but only in making money. But they perfectly know what those idiotic - pop corn - audiences wish. If those idiots wish garbage, craps, formatted, predictable stuff, so the producers will produce garbage, craps, formatted films. They will take no risks producing artist directors who will insist to make their OWN movies, with their own dreams, guts, blood, soul.... The producers from the East Coast won\\'t risk the financial collapse to satisfy the director\\'s more or less madness, delusions.... If I was a producer IN LOVE with a project, but about which I knew in advance that NO ONE will never go to see it, I would not produce it. But all producers are not like this, some of them love risks, are daring. Look for instance Harvey Weinstein,, he trusted Quentin Tarantino.... And he was right. I don\\'t think that every producer in Holllywood would have done the same.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 128}), Document(page_content=\": 129\\nReview_Date: 23 March 2024\\nAuthor: MB-reviewer185\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: He came from nothing.

The Ridley Scott historical movie Napoleon (2023) was ok, it had good performances with nice cinematography and entertaining battles, but the movie's pacing is slow with it all together being a mess on how scenes are put together and the movie feels longer than it is; there are interesting scenes with there being less focus on the battles, and there is more focus on Napoleon Bonaparte and his wife Josephine, which can be disappointing if you just came to see how the battles will be portrayed.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 129}), Document(page_content=\": 130\\nReview_Date: 2 March 2024\\nAuthor: chrisforeman-01920\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Disappointing but not a disaster.\\nReview: I was advised by friends , who had seen the movie, not to bother and wait till appeared on Apple.

I thought this could be a masterpiece, with an incredible cast, Ridley Scott, who is an incredible producer/director and obviously Napoleon's story itself is really interesting. The potential of this movie however got totally wasted. Firstof all, the plot feels extremely rushed. The crew had the ideas, for a movie, which would have been around 4-5 hours long. But of course they massively cut away things, resulting in a 2h40 speedrun through the plot. But that's not the worst part, because I'm pretty sure they could have used more war scenes, but instead they cut to Napoleon an Josephine n bed, during the most random moments. The movie really suffers from that. If it belongs to Napoleon' story, then you would have to put it in, but you shouldn't be damaging the great war scenes, which this movie contains. And lastly, there are quite a few historical inaccuracies, for example Napoleon shooting at the pyramids or him witnessing Marie-Antoinette's death which never happened. All these things are quite annoying and really make the movie worse. I expected a masterpiece, but I got a mess. The only reason I give this a 6/10 is because the war scenes are quite entertaining.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 132}), Document(page_content=\": 133\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: jwoodsvf14\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: A spectacle, a masterpiece in cinematography!

The breadth of content they touched on was impressive, literally from his rise to power and gis fall with the terror thrown in.

Yes, we see Napoleon's life to a certain extent. In particular, we can understand the morbid maternal bond very well. In the battle scenes, Ridley Scott again made his own signature. But this story should have been made into at least two movies. If we want to understand Napoleon, it is very difficult to achieve, understand and explain this with a single film. That's why the movie is incomplete. Still it was a nice experience. The clash scene on the ice was perfect. Joaquin Phoneix is amazing again. I loved it but, as I said, It could be better.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 139}), Document(page_content=': 140\\nReview_Date: 30 December 2023\\nAuthor: adrianovasconcelos\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Superbly shot battle scenes do not repair wooden Phoenix, uneven script, mish-mash score\\nReview: Financially, Ridley Scott rates one of the most successful directors in the history of cinema - so I expected more from this film. I am not even talking about historical inaccuracies like failing to heed Napoleon\\'s young age (23) when he recaptured Toulon (Joaquin looks well in his 40s, too old for the part from the outset); the fact that in reality Josephine was older than Bonaparte, though Vanessa Kirby looks young and wearing a sexily short hairstyle probably caused by her time in the clink, otherwise completely out of tune with late 19th Century women\\'s hairstyles and wigs); the unpardonable failure to mention the importance of Rouget de Lille\\'s national anthem, and how Napoleon used it repeatedly to arouse his troops\\' nationalistic fervor and preserve their loyalty; or the fact that Napoleon ordered his troops to live off the land by plundering property, raping, and killing civilians, with the booty then transferred to France; Napoleon\\'s famously enigmatic call \"Soldiers! From atop these pyramids 40 centuries look down on you\" is ignored, which is a pity because it leaves out Napoleon\\'s extensive general knowledge, ability to convey ideas in stylistic phrases, his knowledge of his soldiers, down to privates whose children\\'s names he carefully memorized, and the fact that he was an avid reader of all manner of books, notably the classics.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 140}), Document(page_content=\": 141\\nReview_Date: 13 January 2024\\nAuthor: annlevtex\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: A Child With His Toy Soldiers\\nReview: The title of my review refers to the director of the movie as well as to Napoleon himself, as played by Phoenix.

As one might expect, on a reported 200 million budget, the sets, costumes and locations are luxuriously and lusciously delivered.

I like Phoenix as an actor but in this he is just terrible and badly cast, his accent twangs against the grain of everyone else and he pretty much dials in his performance. Every character is paper thin (most characters come and go and you have no idea who they are), the film lurches from random scene to random scene like it has been edited by a child. It dredges along at snail pace occasionally lifted by the odd five minutes of well shot battle scenes. I knew it was not an action film but i didn't expect a Hallmark level drama (apologies to Hallmark most of their films are better than this).

Grand epic cinema, but flawed execution.\\nReview: I love Ridley Scott. I enjoy the historic story of Napoleon. Great costumes and scenery. Phoenix looks the part and has the emotional complexity, however, his painfully mumbled American accent is rough. This is even harder given that the other actors have a clearly British accent, yet they are all French. The Napoleon story is fascinating and Scott tries to tell a very complex story, but he misses the mark far too many times. But the fight scenes--and there are many--are amateurish. Scott has taken so much time to get teh visuals right, but the fight scenes often look so fake they look like a TV movie. And the accents vary so wildly, it's comedic. Might win an award for costumes. And it does make me appreciate history more--but I wish the film were better.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 152}), Document(page_content=\": 153\\nReview_Date: 5 December 2023\\nAuthor: gaelrodriguez-41656\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: I just didn't feel it\\nReview: I mean, its not that bad but... it could be way better with names like Phoenix or Ridley Scott.

The movie is not bad, but it is not a good movie either. The disadvantage of the movie is that, although it should have been a 4 - 5 hours film, it was trimmed by nearly 3 hours. I understand. But events pass very quickly. Too fast. When the coronation ceremony took place, I said to myself, when did we come here? :) The movie goes by very fast. Another thing I didn't like in the movie was the editing. I didn't like the editing of the movie at all. Moreover, it was impossible to understand Napaleon's reaction to the events, what he was thinking at that moment, and what kind of emotions he was experiencing. At least speaking for myself, I didn't understand. The good aspects of the movie are many. That's why I'm undecided whether to like the movie or not. There were some very good things in the movie. For example, the cinematography was very good. I think Dariusz Wolski did a very good job. Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby became the stars of the movie. They were very good at acting. I would have liked it more if Joaquin Phoenix (had played a calmer style) act little more enthusiastic. But Venessa did a much better job. Ridley Scott is old now, but I feel like he's making one good movie and one average movie. Sometimes. I liked the battle scenes. There were really good. Anyway, this movie was one of the disappointments of this year. I didn't get bored while watching it in the cinema, and I enjoyed it, but it was still a weak and average movie. By the way, the music of the movie was not good. I expected more epic music. I unintentionally wanted to hear ABBA - Waterloo song during the Waterloo battle scenes :)\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 163}), Document(page_content=': 164\\nReview_Date: 22 December 2023\\nAuthor: jp_91\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: \"Napoleon\" is not the best film of the year, nor the best directed by Ridley Scott, but it manages to have good moments without being a masterpiece.\\nReview: \"Napoleon\" is the new film by the legendary Ridley Scott, but it is bittersweet.

At nearly 86 years old, Scott has all of the leverage and experience to transform rigid stories into massive epics and he does so yet again with \"Napoleon.\" Whether this film is meant to showcase the evolution of a character or the evolution of a romantic partnership, both arcs feel scattered without a reasonable understanding as to why Scott delved into this story to begin with. 2h and 38m of repetitive sequences dull the blade of a film that is filled with beautiful locations, historically immersive sets, and acting performances that could have been elevated if given the chance. Joaquin Phoenix is miscast in a role that requires a brute-like performance which proves to be different than the demeanor and quality that he can provide, while Vanessa Kirby stuns as his female counterpart.

It is neither historically or even time line wise accurate. It attempts to cram a 25 year period of extraordinary events and implications into 3 hours. It manages to be both too long and too brief all at the same time. If you have an interest in history this movie will inform you not even a little. If you know about this period in history you will, like me be utterly underwhelmed and completely disappointed. Joachim Phoenix spends the entire movie portraying a cross between an old and tired Napoleon and a costumed Joker. It's sadly beyond poor and sadly awful. I don't understand how Hollywood can spend so much on something so poor and inadequate. How is it possible to tell one of history's most astonishing stories and turn it into a poor telling of an inaccurate, vague and boring film based in false narrative and inaccuracy.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 178}), Document(page_content=': 179\\nReview_Date: 8 December 2023\\nAuthor: theromanempire-1\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: napoleon ? josephine more likely.....\\nReview: I thought the movie was called napoleon.

The film follows Napoleon Bonaparte\\'s rise and fall as emperor of France while also showing his rocky relationship with his wife, Empress Josephine.

Even when Napoleon is in Egypt, during daylight scenes, I wanted to scream for them to turn some lights on. I guess Ridley Scott wanted natural lighting, but that much authenticity is not needed. I think of Braveheart, another long biopic largely depicting European politics and battles. The scenery in that movie still looked natural while having the actors illuminated. It's just so prominent that I can't avoid it. I'm surprised it's not another relaunch of a Batman series.

Really, it is a dialog that is so juvenile I could not believe it. Ridley Scott is a great director, one reason I hoped this film would be better than the ratings, but I was wrong. Napoleon is portrayed as a sex hound and tolerates his wife who likes to sleep around. There are many inaccuracies in this film, something that was unnecessary. First, Napoleon was 6 years younger than Josephine, not 1 year. The incident at Austerlitz was drama and there was not the massive drownings as depicted. Napoleon did not shoot a cannon at the pyramids. And I can go on. This basically a Hollywood version of reality and mediocre at best.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 184}), Document(page_content=\": 185\\nReview_Date: 21 December 2023\\nAuthor: fredrikgunerius\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Ridley Scott both fails and succeeds\\nReview: Large-scale biopics of historical figures will always have both a great advantage and a great disadvantage going into the project, which is demonstrated perfectly with Ridley Scott's latest foray into the genre. On the one hand, the life and times of the great French military leader and ultimately failed emperor Napoleon Bonaparte is so fascinating that any adaptation of a magnitude such as this can hardly fail to impress. On the other hand, most of this is known material for the average viewer, which means that one of Scott's most important tasks is to breath new life into the story and tell it in a way which sets it apart and embellishes it. He both fails and succeeds in this with Napoleon. One of the main achievements of this film are the battle scenes, which have a wonderful sense of space and scope. Among Napoleon's most prominent skills was his tactical prowess on the battlefield, and there are one or two decisive sequences in here which illustrate this in a detailed and quite engrossing manner. Another aspect which almost is able to transport you back to 18th and 19th century France is the film's thorough dissection of the complicated, life-long love affair between Napoleon (Joaquin Phoenix) and Joséphine de Beauharnais (Vanessa Kirby). Through their correspondence, we get a sense of the many conflicting emotions they had, and why a high-profile relationship in their day and situation was so difficult. In a handful of scenes, Phoenix and Kirby are able to generate an intensity in their interplay which lifts this from interesting to captivating. Unfortunately, the latter cannot be said of Napoleon in its entirety. Scott isn't able to give his film any sort of real French identity, and the feeling of authenticity suffers for it. Phoenix' take on the character lacks both Frenchness and a charisma which would help explain the man's societal success. There are also too many segments which feel bogged down by the director's inability to bridge the temporal gap between our time and Napoleon's. That isn't to say he doesn't try or even occasionally succeed quite well, but as a total for a film of this scope, running time and historical relevance, Napoleon falls a little short - which incidentally could be said to mirror the man himself quite well.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 185}), Document(page_content=\": 186\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: philipdustson\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Cold.

You expect to see Napoleon, some battles and some historical events and explanation. Napoleon barely delivers such things. It is a very strange movie that makes some undeniably bad choices in terms of what it chooses to focus on. Most of the story is centered not around Napoleon, but around Josephine. She is his wife and muse and he simps hard for her. Almost everything in the movie is bent to fit around her in some way and it turns what should have been a little sideplot into the main focus of almost every single thing in this movie. It makes this 200 million dollar movie feel like a cheap romantic B-film.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 188}), Document(page_content=': 189\\nReview_Date: 25 November 2023\\nAuthor: thunderboltmuzik\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Absolute MASTERPIECE.\\nReview: In a world in which a marvel movie can get 8.5 on imdb while an Epic gets a 6.8, what can we say?!

The truest spoiler from my experience was my very basic understanding of the period of history. It seemed more accurate than the movie.

Yes he's a dog sometimes in the movie but it's funny and does a good job of making you feel uncomfortable which is good because that's how you should feel watching this movie. As for historical inaccuracies, I've done some research and I don't see where the movie is off or says anything blatantly wrong. The only thing I can point to is where the cannon hits a pyramid. Here's why that's a good choice for the film: the battle is not shown but a rumor or myth about Napoleon is- that he shot up a pyramid with cannon. (And using the nose of the Sphinx as target practice). It illustrates that Napoleon won the battle AND that he is becoming a legend. It's an artistic expression that I don't mind.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 199}), Document(page_content=\": 200\\nReview_Date: 11 December 2023\\nAuthor: zmichelleprevatt-38312\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Wildly different take than most\\nReview: As a historian, I didn't hate this movie. I didn't love it, not do I think it's historically accurate. However, it was interesting. I believe some of this is maybe how Napoleon would recount his own life, emphasizing on Josephine and glossing over other factors. Those letters are a big look into his inner psyche and a big part of what we have to go on. I think this is a case of an unreliable narrator, Napoleon himself. Making some things lighter than they were and making himself look like a better more humanized version of himself. If you're looking for accuracy it isn't here. If youa re looking for a glorified version of how he may have wanted history to perceive him, look no further.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 200}), Document(page_content=\": 201\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: jadeperigault\\nRating: 2\\nReview_Title: Why my French person didn't like it\\nReview: First things first as a French person, I take into count that the way Napoleon is seen in France and why other people knows him may be a lot different.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 201}), Document(page_content=\": 202\\nReview_Date: 25 November 2023\\nAuthor: davidfilippelli\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Napoleon story in a funny and romantic way\\nReview: Very solid performances in a visually stunning film that is in some part is too fast and doesn't give the time to feel the importance of the moment.

The battles were visually incredible and directed in a perfectly way, especially the last one, but some of the battles and the crucial point of the battles were too fast and it maked the tension of the film low and if you count that there's a lot of humor the tension is Literally zero.

I was really looking forward to seeing Joaquin Phoenix capturing the character and watching him shine once again but in this movie he really disappointed me. He did not understand Napoleon as a character at all. The reason of the devotion of the soldiers to Napoleon was because of his drive and his passion. I did not see any of this. Instead, just a dull summary of the different wars he fought with only a mentioning of the rational reasons why. Also Napoleon is known for more than only the wars he fought. He's the reason we all carry last names for example. The scene with the swords is a sorry excuse of portraying this.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 203}), Document(page_content=': 204\\nReview_Date: 23 March 2024\\nAuthor: nategerard77\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Problems from the start\\nReview: I love the work of Ridley.

Being a well read student of Napoleonic history I have been looking forward to this for some time, although having seen one or two of the historical inaccuracies present in the trailer it did put me off, but I thought the battle scenes should be good. I was however wrong. Napoleon is a tawdry piece of effluence. The historical inaccuracies seen in the trailer are but a defecators flourish on the Mr Whippy style pile of excrement this film has become. Phoenix is plain terrible, unbelievable, childish... I thinking casting R2D2 in the role would have been more believable. The supporting cast, aside from Josephine, were instantly forgettable. Rupert Everett as Wellington was so uninspired and his one liners so full of cheese I swear he was sponsored by babybell. The score, script and acting made one think one was watching a channel 5 reconstruction of the life of Napoleon... this is probably doing them a disservice as even they of probably have read the lady bird book of Napoleons battles and perhaps had a game of Napoleon Total War before they committed pen to paper... Scott obviously thought such research was a waste of time and instead watched Black Panthers defence of Wakanda for practical tactical Napoleonic tips. Certain Waterloo bore more resemblance to some kind of trench warfare and was later inspired by Jar Jar Binx and the Gungans battle with the evil trade federation. In fact at one point I literally thought I was watching Monty Python's Batley Womensguild reenactment of the battle of pearl harbour. Suffice to say please, please, please don't watch this film if you have any interest in Napoleon or Napoleonic warfare. I don't know how much clearer I can be.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 208}), Document(page_content=\": 209\\nReview_Date: 24 November 2023\\nAuthor: benjaminumbdenstock\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: The Napoleon movie, it's highs and lows\\nReview: The only real complaint I have with the movie is that I wanted more. While I loved the large open battlefields and the inter workings of Napoleon's life. I felt that at times the plot moved too fast or too slow. Despite that, many other people have been criticizing the choices to dive into Napoleon's lover Josephine for a significant part of the movie. However, I think that this decision was the right idea. Napoleon had a life outside the battlefield, and exploring that with his place in the French Revolution were the building blocks to show the audience the motivation behind his actions. His lover Josephine was a significant part of his life, it only makes sense for her to have a significant portion of the screen time. My favorite part was the ambush of the Russo-Austrian troops. We see Napoleon use his cunning military knowledge to ambush and completely destroy his enemy. All and all, the only aspect holding this movie back is not having that full cut, which I will be sure to watch once it comes out. I would definitely watch this movie again.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 209}), Document(page_content=\": 210\\nReview_Date: 25 November 2023\\nAuthor: koltonbrett\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Not bad, but not what was advertised\\nReview: This is another case of people getting a different movie than they were likely expecting.

This movie is neither fun nor good. I was bored, I knew what would happen and surprisingly, since I don't like war movies, my favourite parts were the battles. They looked amazing. The acting performances were solid, but just like in Killers of the Flower Moon there were no relatable characters, there wasn't anybody to root for and I need that in a film. This movie is long, boring and does not show anything new. Ridley Scott's acting, the cinematography Joaquin Phoenix's and Vanessa Kirby's acting could not save it. I think this movie is really mediocre.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 213}), Document(page_content=': 214\\nReview_Date: 24 November 2023\\nAuthor: CinemaSerf\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Napoleon\\nReview: I think this is one of those films, like his \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005) epic that Sir Ridley Scott has made for aficionados of grand scale historical cinema, not for historians. Indeed it may well be that for this film, the less you actually know about the subject the more you might enjoy it. We start with the demise of Marie Antoinette and see Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) watching from the baying crowd. He\\'s a relatively junior officer but an aspirational one who manages to sell a plan to relieve the British occupied city of Toulon to his boss Barras (Tahar Rahim). This success sets him on a parabola that sees him rise, his falling in/out/in of love with the charismatic Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) and his overwhelming desire for European domination. The narrative clearly illustrates the fickleness of dynastic politics, trust and betrayal, love, lust and shrieking hypocrisy in a colourful and vibrant fashion. I didn\\'t love Phoenix in this role, but maybe because Rod Steiger was so convincing in \"Waterloo\" (1970) that at times he looked a little like a mimic. That said, though, he puts his heart and soul into the role and the increasingly toxic dynamic with Kirby manages to stay on the right side of melodrama throughout. Again, as with Sir Ridley\\'s tale of Jerusalem from eighteen years ago, he manages to pull off some spectacular battle scenes and the cinematography captures well the hostile environments - human and natural - faced by the soldiers as his empire building rose and fell. Although it\\'s over 2½ hours long, I felt the focus was rather imbalanced. A long time spent on his rise to power then his decline and fall rather rushed. Dare I say it, but this might have worked better as a part one and a part two scenario. It looks stunning and the creative forces behind the costumes and visual effects are bound to be picking up a slew of gongs in due course. The acting, well that\\'s less impressive and though I do enjoy the genre, I fear this may just end up being famed for some historical inaccuracies rather than being for an outstanding biopic of one of the world\\'s most enigmatic and flawed megalomaniacs.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 214}), Document(page_content=\": 215\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: shahrad\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Only impossible is impossible...\\nReview: First things first, we must wait for the director's cut version which is said to be more than four hours. For I believe it could be the reason of some inconsistency of the storyline in the first half of the film. Nonetheless, Napoleon is visually stunning filled with breathtaking shots, amazing cinematography, spectacular battle scenes, some great score, compelling performance by Joaquin Phoenix and of course remarkable direction of Ridley Scott which can eventually bring him an Oscar next year. Vanessa Kirby was acceptable too as the empress Josephine. However, I believe there would be a huge difference between the theatrical version and the director's cut and accordingly require different rates. 7/10 so far!\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 215}), Document(page_content=\": 216\\nReview_Date: 25 November 2023\\nAuthor: bergy-97063\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: 10 only cause yall underrated this\\nReview: I'd probably give this theatrical version an 8.5 only because you can obviously tell there has been sooooo much cut out. From what we know 2hrs of film where removed from what Scott intended. Much like what happened with Kingdom of Heaven when it came out and got mid/mixed reviews and then the Directors cut came out and basically everyone agreed it was a masterpiece almost on the level of Gladiator. I think Napoleon will be the same but more extreme. This is only half of the film and you can tell, and even at that it's an amazing watch. I understand that most people don't want to watch a 4 1/2 hrs movie which is why it was cut down, but it's 20 years of history that deserves a long runtime. I hate to see this only have mid reviews so I'm giving it a 10 and trust me when the full version comes out it will be a 9 or 10. This film is beautiful and might be Scott's best cinematography ever.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 216}), Document(page_content=': 217\\nReview_Date: 28 November 2023\\nAuthor: TheDestroia\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Blood, gore, dark and gritty.\\nReview: Storytelling 7/10\\nBlood and gore: High\\nVisuals 10/10\\nActing 9/10\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 217}), Document(page_content=\": 218\\nReview_Date: 24 November 2023\\nAuthor: sanjkeee\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Napoleon: Is It Cake?\\nReview: Introduction:\\nThe highly anticipated biopic from Sir Ridley Scott, starring Phoenix and Kirby and based on one of the greatest possible stories!

Sir. Scott tries to psychoanalize Napoleon with a tendency to the worst making him a clownish brute; or a joker, theryby the poor casting choice of Joaquim Phoenix. The film is almost a comedy; but at the end Scott tries to moralise listing the deaths assumingly left by Napoleon in the European battlefields. Also he tells us that Josefine basically treated Napoleon with disdain and contempt that is not historically documented. This is an Anglo film about a great Frenchman and French history that is not going to help the UK and their misguided Brexit to get back into Europe.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 221}), Document(page_content=\": 222\\nReview_Date: 28 November 2023\\nAuthor: bryanpsweeney\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Good movie, with one major issue\\nReview: This film has the unique challenge of trying to satisfy two groups that are hard to satisfy: cinephiles and historians.

First of all DO NOT and I repeat: DO NOT watch the movie if you're expecting to see a historically acurate movie. If you are an historian or Napoleon fan, I know it is tempting but trust me, this is not the film for you. With that sat aside it is very important to say that I went to the cinema with only the expectation to be entertained. All tough the movie was a bit longer than I expected it was never boring. As expected from the trailer, the heart of the movie are magnificent battle scenes which just do make fun to watch. The cinematography was beautiful, it is rich of scenery with the right amount of cut scenes, colour, length and creativity. A lot of creativity was also involved in the interpretation of Napoleon Bonaparte. A few articles told, Jaoquin Phoenix had a considerable part how the character should be depicted, I can say: Jaoquin, that wasn't it. Napoleon, the man who conquered Europe, came out of exile to resuscitate the monarchy in France after the French revolution and who lead million of people to the battlefield felt more like a sweet adopted dog with a good heart but certain quirks. The absolute absurdity of him interacting with his wife Josephine, played remarkably by Vanessa Kirby, felt straight up like it would belong in a Mister Bean movie. In some scenes I had trouble of not cringing out of my seat and me and my friend, I was watching the movie with, had to giggle and fight the urge of Napoleon feeling cute. Anyway, pair this with the exploding horses, completely unnecessary close-ups of people being slaughtered to death by cannonballs, cannonballs and also CANNONBALLS!!! As well as staggering scenes of Napoleon shooting the Pyramids and you'll definitely feel entertained. I have the feeling I know less about Napoleon than before and I don't even care! I do not regret watching the movie in the slightest and I also don't want to ever see it again. For me a one hit wonder: 7/10.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 240}), Document(page_content=': 241\\nReview_Date: 27 April 2024\\nAuthor: durtguitar\\nRating: 1\\nReview_Title: A Historical Disaster\\nReview: I have never witnessed such a monumental mishmash of historical inaccuracies and creative liberties as in \"Napoleon,\" starring Joaquin Phoenix.

The movie tries to examine Napoleon\\'s rise to power, his many victories in all his different battles, his love life with Josephine, and sees him through the main events of his life all the way to his end. Although the movie has a huge history to cover, it simply only manages to showcase some of the events in Napoleon\\'s life and those only as bullet points, almost like a quick history lesson. Ridley Scott wanted to examine his very passionate relationship with his wife Josephine, his total infatuation with her and his true love with her. The script really struggles to keep a balance with his eventful life and his more than eventful marriage. Joaquin Phoenix tries really hard to give substance to Napoleon, but sadly his performance feels somewhat like a farce. Maybe this was the way they wanted to present him, but my concern is that in this almost 3 hour long biopic I don\\'t feel like I got to see who Napoleon really was. On the other hand Kirby stole every scene, she\\'s commanding every frame. And yes the battle scenes are epic and absolutely masterfully choreographed and filmed, but after all the battle and all the glory, Bonaparte still remains underdeveloped in my eyes. I just simply wish I knew what the purpose of the movie was, because I certainly feel like I really don\\'t know the man in the picture. The movie ends and you have an idea of who he may have been, but never truly more than just a glimpse of him. His mind remains a mystery. Ridley Scott took on a very ambitious project, but the final result sure feels underwhelming.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 242}), Document(page_content=\": 243\\nReview_Date: 28 November 2023\\nAuthor: pappywatts\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Disappointing,flawless directing cinematic plenty of action ,lack of empathy\\nReview: Looked forward to seeing Ridley Scott's latest endeavour,mostly filmed in England, lotsa Versailles style mansions here apparently, sumptuous staging for battles ,costumes, uniforms accurate for the period, and massive cast.

Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content=': 3\\nReview_Date: 22 November 2023\\nAuthor: Vic_max\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep\\nReview: Many of Ridley Scott\\'s movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines.

This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing.

More importantly, a story of such epic proportions is much better suited as a miniseries (along the lines of HBO's John Adams). In fairness, as other reviewers have mentioned, the Apple TV version was almost 4 hours long, so the theatrical version had to be cut by almost 2 hours. The result leaves the viewer trying to decipher the timeline and fill in missing details as the story leapfrogs huge gaps of time. Napoleon's character is complex and he's shown as brave, scared, sniveling, proud, steadfast and prideful. Without the full story, that odd mixture of traits is a little confusing, despite Phoenix's strengths.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 25}), Document(page_content=': 26\\nReview_Date: 10 December 2023\\nAuthor: trevjohns\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Should have been called Napoleon and Josephine', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 26}), Document(page_content='Review: This should have been called \"Napoleon and Josephine\" because, frankly, there\\'s too much of Josephine in it, and not nearly enough of the brilliance and personality of Bonaparte.

While this concern was already there before release, we have seen great movies about bigger-than-life men and women succeed like Gandhi (1982). And with a director like Ridley Scott, you want to give the project the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, The movie falls into the trap that has haunted other biopics which is a lack of focus.

And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable.

It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 33}), Document(page_content=': 34\\nReview_Date: 3 April 2024\\nAuthor: frogcilfruit\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Why bother with actual history...\\nReview: ...when you can use a famous historical figure for publicity and just make up an alternate story that better fits your views, whims, or \"vision\" ?\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 34}), Document(page_content=\": 35\\nReview_Date: 9 December 2023\\nAuthor: adambarta\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Hollywood overtaking over quality\\nReview: Once I found out that there will be a movie about Napoleon starring Joaquin Phoenix, I got excited.

The cinematography, sets, and acting all al superb. Joaquin Phoenix, although he might have not been the best casting for a 22 year old. The Battle of Austerlitz really showcases Ridley Scott's amazing eye for shots. But even with all of that, there are some bad things. Around halfway through the film, the pacing really slows down. It is still very much enjoyable, but it could definitely be improved upon. One thing that distracted me from the plot were the scenes between Joaquin Phoenix and Vannessa Kirby's characters, where Napoleon was making animal sounds while trying to impregnate her. Overall, I enjoyed the film.

Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.

I think it's cute how plenty of old folks go to see this I'm 31 though I enjoyed a lot of the movie my only problem is it was a little slow at times.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 68}), Document(page_content=\": 69\\nReview_Date: 24 November 2023\\nAuthor: RightOnDaddio\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Who Knew There Were This Many French History Scholars and Napoleon Devotees Here Writing Movie Reviews?

The practical effects in this are soooo good this helps cleanse the pallet after decades of green screen super hero's! We have a refreshing new look in to Napoleon! Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar again or at least get a nod from the guild then the Oscar's are truly dead, well when you pick Jimmy Kimmel to be the front man then you know they are dead.

This is also unusual for director Ridley Scott, who usually stands for strong action cinema, and here he completely gets involved in dramatic dialogues and a kind of love story. He also implements this phenomenally and well. I expected more battles and more military, but what I got was a romantic film. Is this good or bad? Bad because at over two and a half hours it drags a bit. Good, because the love story is very well told and the short but crisp battle scenes are simply very convincing. The film is worth seeing, but should be viewed with different expectations from the start. A very good film in its own way. Croatia Phoenix in particular is playing phenomenally.

In between, it's an odd relationship with Josephine; he's got old-school masculine ideas about marriage, but the relationship clearly has her in a dominant position.

He had a marquee set of actors, but non of them stand out including Joaquin Phoenix which compared with his performance in Gladiator (first Ridley's film with him) it is a long fall, anyone could have done that part. The screenplay is also clumsy, feels like some sort of documentary without a narrator. And the worst part is that Ridley's interpretation of Napoleon, he puts the main character as a ridiculous man who didn't have any merit and his accomplishments were reached by chance. The war scenes are the only parts of this movie we can rescue, where Ridley is a master.

Ridley Scott is a brilliant director, but, like his subject, his reach exceeded his grasp. The actors are quite good; the contests at Toulon, Borodino, and Austerlitz are covered, but, Russia, where he lost his empire is given scant review. The final defeat at Waterloo is well-staged. The film's major virtue is its fealty to the period: the sets, costumes, makeup, props, and lighting are impeccably reproduced. It is very worthy to be immersed in an earlier period, if only to see how it contrasts with our own, but, alone, it does not make for great drama.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 112}), Document(page_content=\": 113\\nReview_Date: 27 November 2023\\nAuthor: hanschsolo\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Vastly entertaining but shallow, lacking depth\\nReview: Napoleon is so greatly shot and acted, Joaquin Phoenix fits the role and plays the character in various sets of emotions.

Yes, we see Napoleon's life to a certain extent. In particular, we can understand the morbid maternal bond very well. In the battle scenes, Ridley Scott again made his own signature. But this story should have been made into at least two movies. If we want to understand Napoleon, it is very difficult to achieve, understand and explain this with a single film. That's why the movie is incomplete. Still it was a nice experience. The clash scene on the ice was perfect. Joaquin Phoneix is amazing again.

This is even harder given that the other actors have a clearly British accent, yet they are all French. The Napoleon story is fascinating and Scott tries to tell a very complex story, but he misses the mark far too many times. But the fight scenes--and there are many--are amateurish. Scott has taken so much time to get teh visuals right, but the fight scenes often look so fake they look like a TV movie. And the accents vary so wildly, it's comedic. Might win an award for costumes.

The digital special effects, although few, are unreal. \"Napoleon\" is not the best film of the year, nor the best directed by Ridley Scott, but it manages to have good moments without being a masterpiece.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 164}), Document(page_content=': 165\\nReview_Date: 17 May 2024\\nAuthor: vcxmhcnqd\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Not the best but certainly not the worst\\nReview: \"Napoleon,\" directed by Ridley Scott, is an ambitious historical drama that chronicles the life and legacy of one of history\\'s most enigmatic and controversial figures, Napoleon Bonaparte.

I think of Braveheart, another long biopic largely depicting European politics and battles. The scenery in that movie still looked natural while having the actors illuminated.

Really, it is a dialog that is so juvenile I could not believe it. Ridley Scott is a great director, one reason I hoped this film would be better than the ratings, but I was wrong. Napoleon is portrayed as a sex hound and tolerates his wife who likes to sleep around. There are many inaccuracies in this film, something that was unnecessary. First, Napoleon was 6 years younger than Josephine, not 1 year. The incident at Austerlitz was drama and there was not the massive drownings as depicted. Napoleon did not shoot a cannon at the pyramids. And I can go on.

Through their correspondence, we get a sense of the many conflicting emotions they had, and why a high-profile relationship in their day and situation was so difficult. In a handful of scenes, Phoenix and Kirby are able to generate an intensity in their interplay which lifts this from interesting to captivating. Unfortunately, the latter cannot be said of Napoleon in its entirety. Scott isn't able to give his film any sort of real French identity, and the feeling of authenticity suffers for it.

Here's why that's a good choice for the film: the battle is not shown but a rumor or myth about Napoleon is- that he shot up a pyramid with cannon.

I didn't love it, not do I think it's historically accurate. However, it was interesting. I believe some of this is maybe how Napoleon would recount his own life, emphasizing on Josephine and glossing over other factors. Those letters are a big look into his inner psyche and a big part of what we have to go on. I think this is a case of an unreliable narrator, Napoleon himself. Making some things lighter than they were and making himself look like a better more humanized version of himself. If you're looking for accuracy it isn't here. If youa re looking for a glorified version of how he may have wanted history to perceive him, look no further.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 200}), Document(page_content=\": 201\\nReview_Date: 23 November 2023\\nAuthor: jadeperigault\\nRating: 2\\nReview_Title: Why my French person didn't like it\\nReview: First things first as a French person, I take into count that the way Napoleon is seen in France and why other people knows him may be a lot different.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 201}), Document(page_content=\": 202\\nReview_Date: 25 November 2023\\nAuthor: davidfilippelli\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Napoleon story in a funny and romantic way\\nReview: Very solid performances in a visually stunning film that is in some part is too fast and doesn't give the time to feel the importance of the moment. I loved how it showed the relation of Giuseppina and Napoleon, a very complicate story that in the film is showed with a very good touch. The battles were visually incredible and directed in a perfectly way, especially the last one, but some of the battles and the crucial point of the battles were too fast and it maked the tension of the film low and if you count that there's a lot of humor the tension is Literally zero.

I was really looking forward to seeing Joaquin Phoenix capturing the character and watching him shine once again but in this movie he really disappointed me. He did not understand Napoleon as a character at all. The reason of the devotion of the soldiers to Napoleon was because of his drive and his passion. I did not see any of this. Instead, just a dull summary of the different wars he fought with only a mentioning of the rational reasons why. Also Napoleon is known for more than only the wars he fought. He's the reason we all carry last names for example. The scene with the swords is a sorry excuse of portraying this.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 203}), Document(page_content=': 204\\nReview_Date: 23 March 2024\\nAuthor: nategerard77\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Problems from the start\\nReview: I love the work of Ridley.

We start with the demise of Marie Antoinette and see Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) watching from the baying crowd. He\\'s a relatively junior officer but an aspirational one who manages to sell a plan to relieve the British occupied city of Toulon to his boss Barras (Tahar Rahim). This success sets him on a parabola that sees him rise, his falling in/out/in of love with the charismatic Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) and his overwhelming desire for European domination.

The movie tries to examine Napoleon\\'s rise to power, his many victories in all his different battles, his love life with Josephine, and sees him through the main events of his life all the way to his end. Although the movie has a huge history to cover, it simply only manages to showcase some of the events in Napoleon\\'s life and those only as bullet points, almost like a quick history lesson. Ridley Scott wanted to examine his very passionate relationship with his wife Josephine, his total infatuation with her and his true love with her. The script really struggles to keep a balance with his eventful life and his more than eventful marriage.

Despite the middling reviews, I'd say this film was a solid effort. If anything, it did feel a bit too self-aware and because of that it often poked fun at itself (and its main character). The accents were a bit distracting, but I'm not sure what could have been done there. Phoenix's Bonaparte often overplays his American accent and it seems in stark contrast to Kirby's English. By the way, Vanessa Kirby was the best thing about this movie. Shame we couldn't have seen more of her. The action sequences were also very well done and I'm glad Scott didn't try to make them more artsy. In many ways this film is a reach back to Gladiator and other period dramas of yesterday that we need more of in the future. Definitely worth your while.\n",

(There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 127}),\n",

He was absolutely right. Despite the middling reviews, I\\'d say this film was a solid effort. If anything, it did feel a bit too self-aware and because of that it often poked fun at itself (and its main character). The accents were a bit distracting, but I\\'m not sure what could have been done there. Phoenix\\'s Bonaparte often overplays his American accent and it seems in stark contrast to Kirby\\'s English. By the way, Vanessa Kirby was the best thing about this movie. Shame we couldn\\'t have seen more of her. The action sequences were also very well done and I\\'m glad Scott didn\\'t try to make them more artsy. In many ways this film is a reach back to Gladiator and other period dramas of yesterday that we need more of in the future. Definitely worth your while.', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 119}),\n",
              "  Document(page_content=\"Review: Frankly, it was a disappointment to me. The movie is not bad, but it is not a good movie either. The disadvantage of the movie is that, although it should have been a 4 - 5 hours film, it was trimmed by nearly 3 hours. I understand. But events pass very quickly. Too fast. When the coronation ceremony took place, I said to myself, when did we come here? :) The movie goes by very fast. Another thing I didn't like in the movie was the editing. I didn't like the editing of the movie at all. Moreover, it was impossible to understand Napaleon's reaction to the events, what he was thinking at that moment, and what kind of emotions he was experiencing. At least speaking for myself, I didn't understand. The good aspects of the movie are many. That's why I'm undecided whether to like the movie or not. There were some very good things in the movie. For example, the cinematography was very good. I think Dariusz Wolski did a very good job. Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby became the stars\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9465377/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 163}),\n",
